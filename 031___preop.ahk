INFORMED CONSENT DISCUSSION:
The patient was informed that cataract surgery is elective surgery and that
if cataract surgery was not performed, the visual acuity in the eye would
continue to gradually decrease from progression of the cataract. The patient
was reassured this was a reversible form of visual loss and that cataract
surgery could always be done later at a time of the patient's choosing.
 
The cataract surgical procedure was explained to the patient, including
anesthesia options. The risks and benefits of and alternatives to cataract
surgery were reviewed at length with the patient, including but not limited
to infection [endophthalmitis]; cystoid macular edema; retinal detachment;
bullous keratopathy; zonular/posterior capsular rupture; vitreous loss,
vitreous hemorrhage; suprachoroidal hemorrhage; iris trauma; retained lens
fragments; ptosis, and need for additional surgery. It was explained that
many of these and other complications may develop during surgery, weeks or
even years later, and could result in poor vision, loss of vision, or loss
of eye, and that risks are greater with prior eye injury or surgery. The
patient was informed that certain comorbidities and high-risk characteristics
present may influence oralter the expected surgical techniques and/or
outcomes of the procedure. The patient was informed that while surgery
often reduces the need for glasses, most patients use glasses for some or
all activities.
 
It was explained to the patient that an ophthalmology resident would be
participating in the cataract surgery under the close supervision of the
attending physician. The patient voiced an understanding of this and was
in agreement with this plan. The patient was also informed of the need to
understand and respond to instructions and communicate with the team as
necessary during the cataract surgery.
 
Any patient barriers to learning were identified and considered during the
discussion. The patient voiced an understanding of the procedure, risks and
benefits discussed above and all the patient’s questions were addressed by
the provider. The patient elected to proceed with cataract surgery.

GLAUCOMA PROCEDURE:
Option one: The iStent® procedure and its risks, benefits and
alternatives was explained led to the patient at length. The
discussion included but was not limited to: the procedure offered
a good chance to lower the eye pressure when successfully implanted,
but it may not necessarily stabilize the glaucoma; in some cases,
the iStent may not function well at all, even though it was properly
placed; in addition, complications can develop days, months or years
after the surgery and that further medical and/or surgical treatment
may be necessary to manage these complications; and, as with any
intraocular surgery, there may be loss of vision, blindness, loss of
the eye, as well as hemorrhage, infection and injury to the eye.
 
Option two: The trabeculectomy with anti-metabolites procedure
and its risks, benefits and alternatives was explained to the patient
at length. The discussion included but was not limited to: failure to
control eye pressure, with the need for additional medical and/or surgical
treatment (early or late); early or late increase in intraocular pressure;
hypotony; corneal and/or scleral thinning or perforation; infection;
ciliochoroidal detachment; chronic inflammation; and, as with any
intraocular surgery, loss of vision, blindness, loss of the eye, as well
as hemorrhage, infection and injury to the eye.
 
Option three: The glaucoma drainage device procedure and its risks,
benefits and alternatives was explained to the patient at length. The
discussion included but was not limited to: failure to control eye
pressure, with the need for additional medical and/or surgical treatment
(early or late); early or late increase in intraocular pressure;
hypotony; conjunctival thinning and/or erosion with possible extrusion of
the drainage device; corneal edema; corneal and/or scleral thinning or
perforation; infection; ciliochoroidal detachment; chronic inflammation;
and, as with any intraocular surgery, loss of vision, blindness, loss of
the eye, as well as hemorrhage, infection and injury to the eye.
 
It was explained to the patient that an ophthalmology resident would be
participating in the combined cataract-glaucoma surgery under the close
supervision of the attending physician. The patient voiced an understanding
of this and was in agreement with this plan. The patient was also informed
of the need to understand and respond to instructions and communicate with
the team as necessary during the cataract surgery.
 
Any patient barriers to learning were identified and considered during the
discussion. The patient voiced an understanding of the procedure, risks
and benefits discussed above and all the patient’s questions were addressed
by the provider. The patient elected to proceed with the planned combined
cataract-glaucoma surgery.
